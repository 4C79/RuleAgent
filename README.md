## Introduction

RuleAgent is a modest attempt at creating a rule-based agent system that aims to combine traditional rule engines with modern AI techniques for automated reasoning and decision making. We believe this approach might be helpful in scenarios where transparency, interpretability, and precise control are valued.

- 🔄 **Learning Mechanism**: Attempts to learn from historical decisions to suggest rule improvements
- 🛠 **Configuration Options**: Offers customizable templates and settings
- 📊 **Analysis Tools**: Helps visualize rule execution paths and decision processes
- 🔗 **Integration**: Provides REST API and Python SDK
- 🚀 **Performance**: Implements optimized rule matching with parallel processing support

## Status

🚧 **Coming Soon**: The complete source code and documentation will be released shortly. We are currently preparing the final version for public release.
